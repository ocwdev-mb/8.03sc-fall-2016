## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "I decided to include a lot of demos during my lectures because I believe that to learn physics you have to know how to convert everything into mathematics, (…) make predictions, and, finally, compare predictions to experimental data. Demonstrations (…) show that the mathematics we cover in class (relate) to what nature does in physical systems." "— Yen-Jie Lee" >}}

Below, Professor Yen-Jie Lee describes various aspects of how he teaches _8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves_.
